H1           0.75        Highway 1 Gage – Subject to lagoon backwater at low stages (has estimated record for those portions.)  However is important because it is downstream from large production wells
LA           0              Carmel River Lagoon Stage Gage - Can remove from simulation is a stage gage in the Lagoon
NC          1.0          USGS Near Carmel – Quality record below main
PO          0.5          Protrero Creek - Not a major contributor to main stem flow
RC           0.5          Robinson Cyn – Not a major contributor to main stem flow
GC          0.5          Garzas Cyn – Largely bedrock control
GA          1.0          Garzas @ Garzas Rd (Carmel River Confluence) – Important loosing stretch btwn GC and GA
DJ           1.0          Carmel River @ Don Juan Bridge Good main stem gage below major contributing tribs
HI            0.5          Hitchcock Creek – Not a major contributor
RR           1.0          Carmel River @ Rosies Bridge (USGS Robles Del Rio) – Good record on main stem
TU          1.0          Turlacitos Creek – This will be a tricky calibration point, Wtrshed is in rain shadow and usually takes 10 to 12 inches before surface flow due to sandy soils and large alluvial flood plain
SH           0.75        Carmel River @ Sleepy Hollow Weir – Good low flow gage, higher flows are estimated San Clemente Dam spillage
CL           0.9          San Clemente Creek – Good contributor of water, however trout pond in filled from Creek in Spring causes 1 to 5 day drop, otherwise good record
PI            0.9          Pine Creek – Good contributor drains undeveloped granitic watershed
CA          0.8          Cachagua Creek – Takes 8 to 10 inches to start flow, has a number of legal and illegal direct stream diversions too small to include in simulation, but as an aggregate may lower the validity of this gage as a calibration point
BL           0.75        Carmel River Below Los Padres – Good main stem gage will  be affected by releases from Los Padres during low flow periods
LP           0              Carmel River Above Los Padres – once a month reading, not a continuous record, can be removed from the simulation
